This is a simple Dice game which I created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Two players play in this game and the one reaching the total score of 100 first wins.
RULES -

1. One player rolls the dice and the score adds to it's current score except if he rolls a 1, then the current score will get 0 and the other player will get the chance.
2. The player can hold the current score and it will add to his total score but the the other player will get the chance.
3. The Player 1 will get the chance if one opens a new game.
